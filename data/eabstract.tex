    \par The Helmoheltz equation has important application in acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic scattering problems, and has been investigated in many ways. In the area of numerical method, how to solve the problem that those problems are posed on infinte domains is always a popular subject. In his work, Bramble transforms the acoustic scattering problem on infinte domain to the truncated domain using perfectly matched layer method(PML). This work will be continent to simulation, however, it also brings some new problems. The original problem is symmetric with real coefficients, but now is nonsymmetric with complex coefficients.
    
    \par By reading and learning, we consider the truncated acoustic scattering PML problem and develop an efficient approximate method based on two-grid method. The method is to solve a small and complex original problem by standard finit element discretization on a coarse space $V_H$. Based on the coarse solution $u_H\in V_H$, we solve a simple problem in the fine space $v_h$,which is only have the high order terms of original problem, and get a correction $u_h\in V_h$. We prove the existence and uniqueness and the error bound of optimal order of accuracy which is consistent with the standard finite element discretization. Finally, our theoretical claims are supported.
